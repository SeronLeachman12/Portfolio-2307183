         <button class="button0"><h2>  Vision </h2></button><br><br>

          <button class="button2"> <p>My vision for the future is to own my own tech company, God's willing. 
            I aim to gain a deep understanding of how the world operates in the field of technology and to
            identify what I want to incorporate into my company.
</p></button><br><br>

   <button class="button0"><h2> Mission</h2></button></br></br>

     <button class="button2"><p> Currently, my mission is to learn the dos and don'ts of the industry, determine my preferences and aversions, and grasp the content of each course in my degree program until I reach my final year.</p></button><br><br>

  <button class="button0"> <h3> Personality </h3> </button></br></br>

  <button class="button2"><h4>Personality 1</h4>
 <p><b>Determination:</b> One of my strongest personality traits is determination.
Whenever I set an academic goal, I fully commit myself until I achieve it.
This determination helps me stay focused, even when my schoolwork becomes challenging.
For example, when preparing for exams, I dedicate extra hours to revising difficult topics until I completely understand them. 
My determination allows me to maintain good grades and overcome without giving up.
</p></button>

   <button class="button2"><h4>Personality 2</h4>
    <p>
    <b> Curious Nature:</b> My curiosity drives me to ask questions and seek a deeper understanding of every subject.
       I enjoy exploring how and why things work, which makes learning more meaningful to me. 
         This trait keeps me engaged in class discussions and motivates me to apply my knowledge in creative ways. 
        It also encourages me to look beyond surface-level information and develop a genuine passion for discovery.
    </p></button>
    <button class="button2"><h4>Personality 3</h4>
    <p>
       <b>Ambition:</b> I am very ambitious and always strive to reach my full potential.
        My ambition motivates me to set high academic standards and to work diligently towards achieving them. 
        It keeps me focused on long-term goals, such as excelling in my studies and building a successful career. 
        This forward-thinking mindset encourages me to take on new challenges, continuously improve, and move beyond my comfort zone.</button>
    </p></br>

    <button class="button0"><h1>Personal Development</h1></button></br></br>                    

    <button class="button2"><h2>Chapter 4 - 7 of <q>Twelve Pillars</q></h2>

    <h3>Chapter 4 - Achieve Your Goals</h3>

    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p> This chapter stresses that success requires setting clear, written goals. Many people drift through life without direction, but the truly successful are intentional and specific about what they want. Goals act as a compass, giving focus and motivating consistent effort. Without them, distractions easily take over.</button></p>
    <button class="button2"><h3>Reflection & Life Alignment:</h3>
     <p>I realize that while I have dreams, I sometimes leave them vague. This chapter reminds me to write them down and create an actionable plan. For example, instead of just saying, <q>I want to do well in school,</q> I can set a concrete goal like: Maintain at least a 3.5 GPA by dedicating two hours daily to focused study. Aligning my actions with clear goals will give me direction and measurable progress.</button></p>

    <button class="button2"><h3>Chapter 5 - The Proper Use of Time</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p> The authors emphasize that time is life’s most valuable resource. Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day, but the key difference lies in how we use that time. Effective time management involves prioritizing what matters most instead of squandering hours on trivial activities. Successful individuals recognize that time is as valuable as money and treat it as an investment.</button></p>
    <button class="button2"><h3>Reflection & Life Alignment:</h3>
    <p>This helps me to reflect on how I spend my time. At times, I tend to procrastinate or get caught up in distractions like social media. I can apply this lesson by using time blocking, which involves setting aside specific times for studying, exercising, resting, and relaxing. By protecting my time and using it effectively, I can achieve a better balance while steadily working towards my goals.</button></p>

    <button class="button2"><h3>Chapter 6 - Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>This chapter emphasizes the impact of relationships on our lives. The individuals we surround ourselves with influence our attitudes, habits, and ultimately our success. Being in the company of negative, unmotivated, or toxic people can hold us back, while positive, goal-oriented, and supportive individuals can elevate us. Therefore, it is crucial to choose our friends and mentors wisely.</button></p>
    <button class="button2"><h3>Reflection & Life Alignment:</h3>
    <p>I can connect deeply with this because I’ve noticed how being around certain friends affects my mindset. When I’m around motivated people, I naturally feel inspired to push myself. To apply this, I should intentionally seek mentors, peers, and friends who challenge me to grow. I also need to limit my time with people who encourage negative habits, so I stay on track with my aspirations.</button></p>
    <button class="button2"><h3>Chapter 7 - Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>This chapter discusses the idea that personal growth is a lifelong journey. While formal education may conclude with graduation, self-education should persist throughout one's life. Successful individuals often engage in activities such as reading, listening to audio programs, attending seminars, and actively seeking knowledge. It’s important to understand that growth doesn’t happen on its own; it requires intentional effort.</button></p>
    <button class="button2"><h3>Reflection & Life Alignment:</h3>
    <p>This really resonates with me, especially as a student. Sometimes I tend to view learning strictly as schoolwork, but this chapter encourages me to see it as a lifelong practice. I can begin by reading more self-development books, practicing new skills, and seeking knowledge beyond my curriculum. If I commit to continuous learning, I will keep improving myself and remain prepared for future opportunities.</button></p></br></br>

      <button class="button0"><h2>The Person I look you too the must:</h2></button></br></br>

      <button class="button2">
      <p><b>My Hero: Lionel Messi</b></p>
      <p>Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, overcame significant challenges in his youth, including a growth hormone deficiency. Through determination and self-belief, he achieved global recognition and stands as a symbol of perseverance.</p>
      <p>My favourite quote from Messi is:</p>
      <p><q><i>You have to fight to reach your dream. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it.</i></q></p>
      <p>This quote inspires me because it highlights that success requires dedication, patience, and passion. Messi’s journey demonstrates that commitment and humility can lead to achievement, even in the face of adversity.</p>
      <p>Messi is my hero not only for his talent, but also for his humility, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Despite numerous accolades, he remains grounded and focused. His leadership and dedication inspire me to pursue my own goals with consistency and character.</button></p>
      
    <button class="button0"><h1>AI Business</h1></button>

    <button class="button2"><h2>Favourite Idea: AI-based adaptive learning systems</h2>

    <h3>How This Could Be Applied in My World</h3>

    <p>When I say <q>my world,</q> I mean a place like Jamaica or any 
       developing country where schools may not have enough resources, or where students have
       limited access to good tutors.</p>


       <ul>
    
        <li><p><b>Bridging educational gaps</b>: Many students may not have access to quality tutors for all subjects. An AI tutor could help fill those gaps, especially for underserved rural or lower-income areas.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Supporting teachers</b>: AI tutors can act as assistants, helping teachers to identify which students are struggling in particular topics, allowing more targeted interventions.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Scalable and cost-effective</b>: After they are created, AI tools can reach many students without costing much more. This matters in places where there are too many students per teacher and not enough resources.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Flexibility in learning</b>: Students can use AI tutors outside of school hours, at their own pace, revisit difficult topics, and have interactive feedback.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Language and curriculum adaptation</b>: The system can be tailored to local curricula (e.g. the Jamaican exam syllabi) and local languages, making the instruction more relevant.</p></li>
       </ul></button><br><br>

       <button class="button2"><h2>Why It Would Be Useful</h2>
       <ul>
        <li><p><b>Personalization</b> learning outcomes. Students learn differently; some need more practice, others benefit from different explanations or styles.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Immediate feedback</b> helps learning; AI can give hints, corrections in real time, which is hard for human teachers when there are many students.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Accessibility:</b> Even students in remote areas, or with limited time can access help from AI via smartphone or low-cost devices.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Motivation:</b> Some interactive, gamified, or adaptive systems can keep students more engaged.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Teacher workload relief:</b> Teachers can focus more on mentoring, class discussion, and creative activities, while AI supports routine drills, grading, etc.</p></li>
       </ul></button>

      <button class="button2"><h2>Ethical Issues Around AI Tutors</h2>
      <h2>While this idea has strong promise, there are several moral / ethical issues to consider:</h2>
       <h3>Bias and fairness</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><p>The AI system could encode biases — e.g., favour certain dialects of English, cultural contexts, accents, styles of reasoning — that disadvantage students from marginalised groups.</p></li>
        <li><p>It might assume prior knowledge that not all students have.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

       <button class="button2"><h3>Data privacy</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><p>The system will need data about students: their performance, maybe personal information. Ensuring this is safely stored, not misused, and that students/parents' consent is essential.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

       <button class="button2"><h3>Over-reliance and deskilling</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><p>Students might become too dependent on the AI for problem-solving, not develop deeper skills, or struggle when AI isn’t available.</p></li>
        <li><p>Teachers might be sidelined or undervalued, or the pedagogy may shift poorly.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

       <button class="button2"><h3>Access inequality</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><p>While AI can be more accessible, there is still a digital divide: a lack of devices, internet connectivity, or electricity can prevent some students from using it.</p></li>
        <li><p>This can increase inequality if richer students benefit, and poorer students do not.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

       <button class="button2"><h3>Accuracy & accountability</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><p>If the AI gives incorrect solutions or misleading hints, it could do harm (mislearned ideas). Who is accountable?</p></li>
        <li><p>Ensuring the quality of content is crucial.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

       <button class="button2"><h3>Commercialization / cost</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><p>If too expensive or locked behind paywalls, this could exclude the very people who might benefit most.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

       <button class="button2"><h3>Solutions / Mitigations to Ethical Concerns</h3>
       <p>Here are ways to address or reduce the moral and ethical risks:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><p><b>Rigorous bias/audit checks</b>: When building the AI tutor, include diverse data sets; test with students from different backgrounds; have external audits for fairness; allow local content and local dialects / examples.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Strong privacy and consent policies</b>: Clear consent from students/parents; data anonymization; secure storage; minimal collection of sensitive personal data; compliance with local legal frameworks for data protection.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Blended learning models</b>: Ensure AI augments, not replaces, human teaching. Teachers remain central; AI used as a tool, not a crutch. Encourage skills like critical thinking, problem solving, not just answer-getting.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Offline modes or low-bandwidth options</b>: For regions with limited internet/devices, provide versions that work offline, via SMS, via light apps; possibly use community centres or schools as hubs.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Quality control & human oversight</b>: Content should be reviewed by subject matter experts; systems should flag uncertainties; allow a human teacher or tutor to correct errors; and provide transparency about what the AI can or cannot do well.</p></li>
       </ul></button></br></br>

      <button class="button2"><h3>Example of an Actual App</h3>
       <p>One concrete example is <b>QANDA</b> (by Mathpresso Inc.).</p>
       <p>What it does: It’s a learning platform where students can take a photo of a math problem, and the system uses OCR (optical character recognition) to read it, then gives step-by-step solutions and learning content.</button></p>
